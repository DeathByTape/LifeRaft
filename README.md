LifeRaft
========

_LifeRaft is still under development and not ready for production use._ This means that APIs may drastically change from version to version.

LifeRaft is intended to be a Haskell implementation of [Raft consensus](http://ramcloud.stanford.edu/raft.pdf) for "real-life." That is, rather than being a toy implementation of the protocol, we provide an easily-accessible interface that handles the entire protocol for you. All you have to write are 2 state machines which describe the behavior of your particular application.

Keep checking back for updates!
